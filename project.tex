An early overview of the content and aims of the Milestones Project appeared in \cite{Friendly:04:gfkl}. Here we update that description and provide a few technical details on some problems that were encountered in attempting to make the history of data visualization convenient for browsing, searching, and analysis.

\subsection{Origin, structure and evolution}\label{sec:structure}
The initial step in portraying the history of data visualization was to create a simple chronological listing of milestone items with capsule descriptions, bibliographic references, markers for date, person, place, and links to portraits, images, related sources and more detailed commentaries. The initial database contained the 105 developments listed by \citet{BenigerRobyn:1978}, and incorporated additional records from \citet{Hankins:1999}, \citet{Tufte:1983,Tufte:1990,Tufte:1997}, \citet{Heiser:2000}, among others.

This began as single \LaTeX\ file (with markup tags for all relevant bits of information), used to produce a hyper-linked PDF document.  A variety of software tools (perl scripts, Unix utilities) allowed us to turn this single source \emph{directly} into the web version originally shown at
\url{http://www.math.yorku.ca/SCS/Gallery/milestone}.  Other custom software tools allowed us to add new milestones items from text files using a template of tags (DATE:, AUTHOR:, WHAT:, REF:, IMG:, etc.) and extract the information about milestones items, authors, images, etc. in a variety of forms (CSV, XML, JSON) that could be used as input for analyses and graphic displays.  For example, \figref{fig:mileyears4} was produced in SAS software using a unix command pipe like \begin{verbatim} itemdb -o milestones.csv < milestones.tex | sas -i milestones.csv mileyears.sas \end{verbatim}

It soon became apparent that such a text-based representation was inadequate. Updating the milestones data required that the single \LaTeX\ file be shared among several collaborators; milestone assets, such as images, web links and references, were not easily accessible by others, which made collaboration cumbersome. Further, each update to the web site required an inefficient number of steps of verification, re-building, and synchronization with the server.

Around 2005, we began to convert the flat file into a relational database and completely redesign the Milestones web site. Specifically, we wanted to facilitate contributions by any number of trusted collaborators via an easy-to-use web administration area, and allow for the dissemination of milestones data via an easy-to-browse public user interface.

Migrating the data to this format provided some challenges. First, the existing milestones data needed to be normalized and redundancy minimized.

Even I am not quite sure what this first sentence means!

To do this, we partitioned the data into its relevant entities: namely the milestone itself, and its descriptors, such as its aspect, author, subject, keywords, reference, and linked media items (such as images). The aspect, author, subject, keyword, and reference descriptors exist as a many-to-many relationship between it and the milestone. For example, an aspect can belong to one or more milestones, and the milestone can belong to one or more aspects. Media items, on the other hand, can only belong to one milestone at a time, with multiple media items possible for a single milestone. \figref{fig:datavis-schema-2} illustrates these relationships.

  \caption{Simplified schema for the MySQL database for the Milestones Project. The main 
  table (\texttt{milestone}) contains information regarding each of the items considered a milestone in the history of data visualization, linked to other tables (e.g., \texttt{reference}, \texttt{mediaitem}) by unique (primary) keys. Other supporting tables (e.g., \texttt{milestone2aspect}) provide for convenient lookups of descriptors of these milestones items (\texttt{subject}, \texttt{aspect}, \texttt{keyword}).
  }
  \label{fig:datavis-schema-2}
\end{figure}

Normalizing the data in this way enabled us to free the database of modification anomalies; ensured that the database structure was scalable, and could be extended with minimum modifications. Most importantly, it allows for future growth, and provides a query-neutral database model \citep{Codd:1971} that could be used for web presentation, and customized search on the \url{http://datvis.ca} site. The last major benefit, which will be demonstrated in \secref{sec:vistime}, is that this schema allows for the analysis of the Milestones data itself.

At present, the Milestones Project documents 288 contributions, with nearly 350 references, information on 336 authors, and 774 media items, made up of 371 images appearing online on the \url{http://datavis.ca/milestone} site, and 403 hyperlinks to images and documents that are externally hosted. In addition, we maintain an offline image database comprising over 1,100 images collected from various sources. Over time, these will also be incorporated into the online database.

\subsection{User interface}
The second challenge related to how to display such a large amount of information in an easy to understand user interface to provide overview, search, and details about these events in the history of data visualization. We decided to retain the time-based grouping of the milestones content by epochs (Pre-1600, 1600s, 1700s, etc.), each with a theme (e.g., 1600--1699: Measurement and Theory) and descriptive text. The visual design of the interface follows Ben Shneiderman's mantra: ``Overview first, zoom and filter, then details on demand'' \citep{Shneiderman:1996:IEEE}. To do this, we added a timeline view (\figref{fig:datavis-timeline2}) of the milestones items displayed on the overview landing page. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]

  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,clip]{fig/datavis-timeline2}
  \caption{Timeline view of the Milestones Project on the site \texttt{http://datavis.ca/milestone}. In this view, the top panel shows a detailed view of the segment of history highlighted in the bottom panel, both of which can be separately scrolled. Items in the top panel show a brief text tag, colour-coded by category. Clicking on an item in this panel brings up small description, which is further linked to the details of the milestone item.}

\end{figure}

This timeline, based on the SIMILE Timeline Widget (\url{http://www.simile-widgets.org/timeline}) allows multiple connected bands, showing events at different resolutions.  Each band can be separately panned by dragging with the mouse pointer, scroll wheel, or keyboard arrow keys. The timeline view, although most obvious, is just one of several possibilities for a visual overview or interaction with the display of the milestones database. The software design of the site, using open-source tool kits, makes it relatively simple to add new ones.  For example, the database can also be navigated via a list view (with drop down quick links), and in \secref{sec:geography} we will illustrate how it can be explored using a map-based display.
