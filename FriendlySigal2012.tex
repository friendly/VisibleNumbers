\title{The Milestones Project: \\ A Database for the History of Data Visualization}
\author{Michael Friendly \and Matthew Sigal \and Derek Harnanansingh}
\date{\today}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Approaches to modern data visualization have evolved substantially from the first thematic maps of the 1600s and the
first bar charts and line graphs
in the early 1800s to the dynamic and interactive graphics of today.
Over the course of this history, scholars have taken a variety of approaches to show how particular factors of interest have changed over time.

The purpose of this chapter is threefold: first, to introduce the reader to an online resource called the Milestones Project. This website highlights important events in the history of data visualization, and enables users to interactively travel through time to see and explore
the context that surrounded their developments. Secondly, we present some visual
examples that
deal with conveying aspects of history
over time, drawn from this resource and discussed in terms of their goals, similarities, and differences.
Finally, the Milestones database itself will be used to showcase how such a resource can serve as an interesting source of information for statistical historiography, which entails the use of statistical and graphical methods for the analysis and understanding of historical innovations, developments, and trends.

\section{Visualizing Time: Historical Precedents}\label{sec:vistime}
\begin{itemize*}
  \item Visions of history from the past
  \item Correlated pasts
  \item Non-linear scales
  \item Dynamic/interactive timelines
\end{itemize*}

\epigraph{What does history look like?  How do you draw time?}{\citet[p. 10]{RosenbergGrafton:2010}}
The questions in this quotation from \emph{Cartographies of Time: A History of the Timeline} \citet{RosenbergGrafton:2010}
introduce an important topic in the history of data visualization: how to visualize this history?
Time provides one obvious dimension, but what else can be included to show the details of a history in a static display
or allow users to see more using dynamic and interactive displays?

We have also provided an annotated visual gallery of some timeline designs and visual histories
in our Data Visualization Gallery at \url{datavis.ca/gallery/timelines.php}. The topics covered
include early visual histories, encyclopedic charts, special purpose charts, correlated histories
showing events in one domain in the context of events in other areas, non-linear scales for
time and space as well as dynamic, interactive timelines.  Here we just consider a few examples.

\subsection{Universal histories}
In addition to unrivaled thematic maps and statistical diagrams, the Golden Age of graphics also
gave rise to a variety of novel attempts to visualize history in a comprehensive manner,
combining parallel, intertwined time-flows, text, illustrations, maps and other visual forms.
Among the most impressive is a series of Synchronological Charts of Universal History
produced by Sebastian Adams between 1871--1885.
The 1881 version is 23 feet long and shows 5,885 years of history, from 4004 B.C. to 1881 A.D.
\citet[p. 172]{RosenbergGrafton:2010} call it ``nineteenth-century America's surpassing achievement in complexity and synthetic power.'' 

\figref{fig:Adams1881} shows just a small portion, but the entire chart can be viewed at
\url{http://www.davidrumsey.com/blog/2012/3/28/timeline-maps}.  Adams used a linear scale for
time, and so you can understand why it took 23 linear feet to include all of recorded history.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Categorization and non-linear scales}

Linear time scales have the advantage that they
provide uniform resolution and detail across the entire time span, but events in time, or our interest in them are rarely uniformly distributed. Most visual histories are rather sparse at their beginning and very
crowded at their end.
Non-linear scales allow resolution to vary smoothly in some other way, providing for greater detail
in regions of greater interest, most often the recent past.


\begin{figure}[!htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,clip]{fig/milecatline}
  \caption{Sketch for a thematic timeline of milestones items, 1500--present,
  categorized by both the Subject (content)
  and Aspect (form) of the milestone item.  To provide greater resolution for more recent events,
  time (Year) is shown on a square-root scale, going backward from the year 2000.
  }
  \label{fig:milecatline}
\end{figure}

\figref{fig:milecatline} is really just a proof-of-concept sketch for something that a graphic artist
could use as a starting point for a chart of
the history of data visualization. It uses the events from the
Milestones Project, categorized by two correlated factors: 
Subject area or content has been
categorized as dealing with human populations, physical properties of the world or
mathematics and statistics; aspect or form has been categorized as dealing with
cartography, graphs and diagrams or technology. 

To provide greater resolution for more recent events, we have used a reverse square-root
scale going backward from the year 2000. Specifically, Year on the horizontal time axis
is actually plotted according to the formula $\textrm{Year}^\star = 2* (25 - \sqrt{(2000 - \textrm{Year})})$,
giving the more pleasing result that the modern period 1800--2000 occupies about 60\% of the scale,
although it comprises only 40\% of the range.

\section{Using the Milestones Project for Statistical Historiography}\label{sec:historiography}
\begin{itemize*}
  \item comparisons of graphical innovations by field (e.g. physical sciences vs. social sciences), in terms of content and form
  \item extract themes and relationships between content areas
\end{itemize*}

\subsection{Statistical historiography}\label{sec:stathist}
We use the term ``statistical historiography,''
to refer to the use of statistical and graphical methods to
explore, study and describe historical problems and questions.%
\footnote{As far as we know, the initial expression of this idea appeared in a paper by
\citet{Rubin:1943} discussing various ways in which statistical methods could be applied
to historical topics.  These included the use of sampling methods to test historical theories,
statistical distributions applied to historical data, and the use of
time series graphs with smoothed curves to study historical trends.
More recently, many examples of the application of these ideas to statistical topics
can be found in \citet{Stigler:1986,Stigler:1999}, as well as our own papers
on the history of data visualization,
cited \emph{inter alia}.
}
This topic has a delightful self-referential quality when applied to the history of data visualization itself,
since we have often found ourselves using modern methods of statistical analysis and graphics to study
the development of ideas in this area.

At the same time, our examination of some of the most
impressive graphic works of the past sometimes left us awe-struck by their exquisite
beauty and visual design.%
\footnote{ Some examples are:
Charles Joseph Minard's famous depiction of Napoleon's March on Moscow \citep{Friendly:02:Minard},
Francis Galton's detailed study of weather patterns in Europe \citep[see:][]{Friendly:2008:golden},
and Andr{\'e}-Michel Guerry's \citep[Plate 17]{Guerry:1864}
semi-graphic table depicting the relations of occurrence of
crimes to a wide variety of social and demographic factors \citep[see:][]{Friendly:2007:guerry}
...
}
On more than one occasion, we wondered whether there wasn't something lost with the advent of modern
software: We can now analyze massive data sets and generate many graphs with simple mouse clicks
or software commands, but designing a truly effective graphic display requires much thought and
a lot of manual intervention.

There is, of course,  one principal requirement for statistical historiography: \textbf{data}.
The milestones database is the repository of all the information we have so far recorded,
and modern database tools allow the possibility of simple or complex queries, limited only
by the available information.

In related work, we have also collected and disseminated
data sets of historical interest on a variety of
topics in statistics and data visualization, for example in the R packages
HistData \citep{HistData} and Guerry \citep{Guerry}.

In the subsections below, we describe a few applications of these ideas using the milestones
database and case studies that arose from this work. There is an interesting interplay between
such historical analyses and these data collections. Some studies called for us to find and
incorporate new data sources, such as our paper \citep{Friendly:2007:guerry} on
Guerry's \emph{Moral statistics of France} and the Guerry package to which we added
Angeville's 1836
extensive data on social and economic characteristics of France.
In other cases, our analyses suggested new or different ways to visualize historical data.

\subsection{Milestone authors: lifespan}\label{sec:lifespan}
As noted earlier, we record information relevant to the contributors of milestones events in an
author table in the database. Internet and biographical searches for these persons allowed us
to determine the dates and places of their birth and death in a large number of cases.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,clip]{fig/lifespan}
  \caption{Density plot of the lifespan of 172 authors in the milestones database born after 1500 and for whom
  lifespan can be determined. Individual observations are shown by a (jittered) rug plot, and the three extremes
  on each end are identified by name.  The dashed lines show the quartiles of the distribution.
  }
  \label{fig:lifespan}
\end{figure}

One simple question is how long did these contributors live? As illustrated earlier (figref:)
Joseph Priestley was the first to develop the idea of using a graphic representation to show
the lifespan of famous men. His ``charts of biography'' did this in a particularly evocative
form, showing each person by a line segment identified by name, and grouped into
occupational categories.

However, such ``lifeline'' charts don't provide any answers to this question.  With the
author table, it is a simple matter to calculate lifespan, and give a direct answer
with the help of software.  \figref{fig:lifespan} shows one display of this information,
using a combined density plot and rug plot, as we used in \figref{fig:mileyears4}.

Several features of this plot deserve comment, and also invite further inquiry:
Most notable is that, by and large, milestones authors generally lived to a ripe old age--
the median lifespan is 73.0, but the density plot peaks at around 79.
This contrasts with a detailed study by
David de la Croix and Omar Licandro (\url{http://www.fcs.edu.uy/archivos/BCU_clebrities.pdf})
of famous people from 2400 BC to 1880 AD,
fluctuating around a mean of 61 years for 4 millennia, and only reaching a mean of 69 years
by the end of their sample. To take this analysis further would require more data, for example
a classification of authors by occupational groups.

Second, there is a noticeable bump in the distribution around 45 years. This
occurrence also calls for some attempt at further explanation.
We don't pursue this here, but again note that such graphs often suggest
further analyses (breakdowns by region or time period)
or cry out for the collection of more data.

Finally, although \figref{fig:lifespan} is just a summary graph, we have labeled a few
extreme observations on each end, which may relate to telling parts of the story of the
history of data visualization.  Among these, Henry Moselely, who is known for the
discovery of atomic number from a graphical display, died the youngest, as a consequence
of serving in the British Army in World War I. But, we were surprised to see
the noted and prolific French cartographer Phillippe Buache
and the German physicist and astronomer Johann Tobias Mayer show up in positions
2-3.  On the other end, we were delighted to see that Adriano Balbi,
a Venetian geographer and early collaborator of Andr{\'e}-Michel Guerry
\citep{BalbiGuerry:1829} had the longest lifespan,
just exceeding the population geneticist, Sewall Wright, who invented
path analysis and the path diagram around 1920.

\subsection{Milestone authors: geography}\label{sec:geography}
The Milestones Project web site provides an initial page showing an interactive timeline
of the events events in this history as a visual overview (\figref{fig:mileyears4}).
A long-term goal has been to
provide other views of this history and other tools for searching and exploring the
database.

The geography of these developments so far is only represented in the birth place
and death place information we recorded in the author table.
For example, we know that Minard was born in Dijon, and died in Bordeaux, but
all of his work was done in Paris while he worked at the
{\'E}cole Nationale des Ponts et Chauss{\'e}es.

Nevertheless, a geographic view of the available information is potentially useful.
In this regard, we used the Google geocoding tools to provide latitude and
longitude for the place names listed in the author table.  Using this and the
R package googleVis \citep{googleVis} we easily created the interactive map shown
in \figref{fig:authormap}

Like other Google maps, this can be panned and zoomed using mouse controls.
The place markers display tool tips when hovered and, when clicked, link to
a search page showing milestone items related to that author.
This tool seems sufficiently useful that we are adding it as another visual
overview page to the milestones site.
