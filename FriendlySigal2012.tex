\title{The Milestones Project: \\ A Database for the History of Data Visualization}
\author{Michael Friendly \and Matthew Sigal \and Derek Harnanansingh}
\date{\today}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Approaches to modern data visualization have evolved substantially from the first thematic maps of the 1600s and the
first bar charts and line graphs
in the early 1800s to the dynamic and interactive graphics of today.
Over the course of this history, there have been many detailed written studies, both comprehensive
and on particular aspects. But there has never been an attempt to collect this history 
in a single place for display, search or query and even data analysis or graphics based on this history.
%scholars have taken a variety of approaches to show how particular factors of interest have changed over time.

The purpose of this chapter is threefold: first, to introduce the reader to an online resource called the Milestones Project. 
This website highlights important events in the history of data visualization, and enables users to interactively travel through time to see and explore
the context that surrounded their developments. Secondly, we present some visual
examples that
deal with conveying aspects of history
over time, drawn from this resource.
% and discussed in terms of their goals, similarities, and differences.
Finally, the Milestones database  will be used to showcase how such a resource can serve as ``data'' 
for \emph{statistical historiography}, which entails the use of statistical and graphical methods for the analysis and understanding of 
historical innovations, developments, and trends.

\subsection{Statistical historiography}\label{sec:stathist}
We use the term ``statistical historiography,''
to refer to the use of statistical and graphical methods to
explore, study and describe historical problems and questions.%
\footnote{
  As far as we know, the initial expression of this idea appeared in a paper by
  \citet{Rubin:1943} discussing various ways in which statistical methods could be applied
  to historical topics.  These included the use of sampling methods to test historical theories,
  statistical distributions applied to historical data, and the use of
  time series graphs with smoothed curves to study historical trends.
  More recently, many examples of the application of these ideas to statistical topics
  can be found in \citet{Stigler:1986,Stigler:1999}, as well as our own papers
  on the history of data visualization,
  cited \emph{inter alia}.
}
This topic has a delightful self-referential quality when applied to the history of data visualization itself,
since we have often found ourselves using modern methods of statistical analysis and graphics to study
the development of ideas in this area. As in the quotation from Swift above, one goal is to make aspects
of this history more visible.

At the same time, our examination of some of the most
impressive graphic works of the past sometimes left us awe-struck by their exquisite
beauty and visual design.%
\footnote{ Some examples are:
Charles Joseph Minard's famous depiction of Napoleon's March on Moscow \citep{Friendly:02:Minard},
Francis Galton's detailed study of weather patterns in Europe \citep[see:][]{Friendly:2008:golden},
and Andr{\'e}-Michel Guerry's \citep[Plate 17]{Guerry:1864}
semi-graphic table depicting the relations of occurrence of
crimes to a wide variety of social and demographic factors \citep[see:][]{Friendly:2007:guerry}.
}
On more than one occasion, we wondered whether there wasn't something lost with the advent of modern
software: We can now analyze massive data sets and generate many graphs with simple mouse clicks
or software commands, but designing a truly effective graphic display requires much thought and
a lot of manual intervention. 

Yet, it is often quite instructive to attempt to re-create or
even re-vision a graphic work from the past \citep{Friendly:02:Minard}. We learn from
this an appreciation of the insight and hard labor of our graphic heros, and
can sometimes better understand or improve on their designs by a process we call
``understanding through reproduction,'' another facet of statistical historiography.

There is, of course,  one principal requirement for statistical historiography: \textbf{data}.
The milestones database is the repository of all the information we have so far recorded,
and modern database tools allow the possibility of simple or complex queries, limited only
by the available information.
\footnote{
  It should be noted that, beyond the basics of recording milestones items, images and references,
  the other meta-data (content and form categories, keywords, etc.) was highly labor-intensive.
  Thanks are due to many research assistants and graduate students who have worked on the Milestones
  Project, including
  Dan Denis,
  Matt Dubins,
  Yvonne Lai,
  Avi Lipton, and
  Carolina Patryluk.
}

In related work, we have also collected and disseminated
data sets of historical interest on a variety of
topics in statistics and data visualization, for example in the R packages
HistData \citep{HistData} and Guerry \citep{Guerry}. These can be considered as
another source for data, pictures and stories
related to statistical historiography and understanding through reproduction.
This is the essence of the motto on the \url{datavis.ca} web site:
\emph{Looking back, going forward}.


In the subsections below, we describe a few applications of these ideas using the milestones
database and case studies that arose from this work. There is an interesting interplay between
such historical analyses and these data collections. Some studies called for us to find and
incorporate new data sources, such as our paper \citep{Friendly:2007:guerry} on
Guerry's \emph{Moral statistics of France} and the Guerry package to which we added
Angeville's 1836
extensive data on social and economic characteristics of France.
In other cases, our analyses suggested new or different ways to visualize historical data.

\subsection{Milestone authors: lifespan}\label{sec:lifespan}
As noted earlier, we record information relevant to the contributors of milestones events in an
author table in the database. Internet and biographical searches for these persons allowed us
to determine the dates and places of their birth and death in a large number of cases.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,clip]{fig/lifespan}
  \caption{Density plot of the lifespan of 172 authors in the milestones database born after 1500 and for whom
  lifespan can be determined. Individual observations are shown by a (jittered) rug plot, and the three extremes
  on each end are identified by name.  The dashed lines show the quartiles of the distribution.
  }
  \label{fig:lifespan}
\end{figure}

One simple question is how long did these contributors live? As illustrated earlier (\figref{fig:timespan})
Joseph Priestley was the first to develop the idea of using a graphic representation to show
the lifespan of famous men. His ``charts of biography'' did this in a particularly evocative
form, showing each person by a line segment identified by name, and grouped into
occupational categories.

However, such ``timespan'' charts don't provide any answers to this question.  With the
author table, it is a simple matter to calculate lifespan, and give a direct answer
with the help of software.  \figref{fig:lifespan} shows one display of this information,
using a combined density plot and rug plot, as we used in \figref{fig:mileyears4}.

Several features of this plot deserve comment, and also invite further inquiry:
Most notable is that, by and large, milestones authors generally lived to a ripe old age--
the median lifespan is 73.0, but the density plot peaks at around 79.
This contrasts with a detailed study by
David de la Croix and Omar Licandro (\url{http://www.fcs.edu.uy/archivos/BCU_clebrities.pdf})
of famous people from 2400 BC to 1880 AD,
fluctuating around a mean of 61 years for 4 millennia, and only reaching a mean of 69 years
by the end of their sample. To take this analysis further would require more data, for example
a classification of authors by occupational groups.

Second, there is a noticeable bump in the distribution around 45 years. This
occurrence also calls for some attempt at further explanation.
We don't pursue this here, but again note that such graphs often suggest
further analyses (breakdowns by region or time period)
or cry out for the collection of more data.

Finally, although \figref{fig:lifespan} is just a summary graph, we have labeled a few
extreme observations on each end, which may relate to telling parts of the story of the
history of data visualization.  Among these, Henry Moselely, who is known for the
discovery of atomic number from a graphical display, died the youngest, as a consequence
of serving in the British Army in World War I. But, we were surprised to see
the noted and prolific French cartographer Phillippe Buache
and the German physicist and astronomer Johann Tobias Mayer show up in positions
2-3.  On the other end, we were delighted to see that Adriano Balbi,
a Venetian geographer and early collaborator of Andr{\'e}-Michel Guerry
\citep{BalbiGuerry:1829} had the longest lifespan,
just exceeding the population geneticist, Sewall Wright, who invented
path analysis and the path diagram around 1920.

\subsection{Milestone authors: geography}\label{sec:geography}
The Milestones Project web site provides an initial page showing an interactive timeline
of the events events in this history as a visual overview (\figref{fig:mileyears4}).
A long-term goal has been to
provide other views of this history and other tools for searching and exploring the
database.

The geography of these developments so far is only represented in the birth place
and death place information we recorded in the author table.
For example, we know that Minard was born in Dijon, and died in Bordeaux, but
all of his work was done in Paris while he worked at the
{\'E}cole Nationale des Ponts et Chauss{\'e}es.

Nevertheless, a geographic view of the available information is potentially useful.
In this regard, we used the Google geocoding tools to provide latitude and
longitude for the place names listed in the author table.  Using this and the
R package googleVis \citep{googleVis} we easily created the interactive map shown
in \figref{fig:authormap}

Like other Google maps, this can be panned and zoomed using mouse controls.
The place markers display tool tips when hovered and, when clicked, link to
a search page showing milestone items related to that author.
This tool seems sufficiently useful that we are adding it as another visual
overview page to the milestones site.


\begin{figure}[!htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,clip]{fig/authormap}
  \caption{Birth places of 188 milestones authors, shown on an interactive Google map, zoomed to show locations
  in part of Europe centered on France. Each geographic marker is linked to a query on
  the \texttt{datavis.ca} web site listing the contributions by that author.
  }
  \label{fig:authormap}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Milestones: themes and trends}\label{sec:themes}
The milestones database records various text fields for each event in this history:
a brief item tag, a full description of the event, relevant keywords, as well as categorical
codes for the content (Subject) and form  (Aspect) of the milestone item.
Treating this information as ``data'' allows us and others to study themes and trends
in these developments.  Modern methods of text mining and data visualization 
can perhaps provide insights into this history not available through other means.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,clip]{fig/milecats4}
  \caption{Mosaic displays for milestones items, classified by Epoch, Subject and Aspect.
  Left: mosaic for the marginal table showing differences in Subject across Epochs;
  Right: mosaic for the marginal table showing differences in Subject across Aspect.
  Numbers in the tiles give the number of milestones items.
  }
  \label{fig:milecats4}
\end{figure}

As one simple illustration of this approach, \figref{fig:milecats4} shows two mosaic displays%
\footnote{Mosaic displays show the frequencies in cells of a cross-classified table
by the area of each tile.  The tiles are shaded according to departure from a null
model of no-association, using blue for cells with frequencies substantially greater
than chance and red for cells with much lower frequencies than expected.
}
exploring the relationships
among Epoch, Subject and Aspect.

The left panel shows changes in the distributions of milestone events by Subject
over time.  It can readily be seen that while most of the milestone innovations
up to the end of the \Cent{18} had were about the 
physical world (astronomy, geodetic measurement, weather, etc.)
in the \Cent{19} there is a large shift to problems related to human populations
(mortality, births, disease, crime).
Beginning in the early 1900s, the pattern begins to shift toward advances in
mathematics and statistics.

The right panel shows the association between Subject and Aspect, pooled over Epoch.
As is not surprising, maps and other cartographical representations were most often
used to show data of the physical world, while graphs and diagrams were most often 
associated with mathematical and statistical subjects.

Other statistical graphs and analyses could be used to explore these and other
relationships
in more detail. The key to this is of course data--- in this case reflected in the
coding of milestones items in the database.



\section{Conclusion and Future Directions}
The Milestones Project began as a simple attempt to collect a comprehensive history of innovations
and developments in data visualization in a single, ``one-stop-shopping'' location.
Like Topsy, it ``just grew'' over time, with images, historical papers and references,
suggestions and other contributions provided
by friends and collaborators, most notably the members of
\emph{Les Chevaliers des Albums de Statistique Graphique}.

In this chapter we describe the second iteration of this project, designed to make this history
more accessible for browsing and searching, and also to begin to make the database more amenable
to additions, edits, and extensions among collaborators.
