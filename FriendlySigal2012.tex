\title{The Milestones Project: \\ A Database for the History of Data Visualization}
\author{Michael Friendly \and Matthew Sigal \and Derek Harnanansingh}
\date{\today}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Approaches to modern data visualization have evolved substantially from the first thematic maps of the 1600s and the
first bar charts and line graphs
in the early 1800s to the dynamic and interactive graphics of today.
Over the course of this history, scholars have taken a variety of approaches to show how particular factors of interest have changed over time.

The purpose of this chapter is threefold: first, to introduce the reader to an online resource called the Milestones Project. This website highlights important events in the history of data visualization, and enables users to interactively travel through time to see and explore
the context that surrounded their developments. Secondly, we present some visual
examples that
deal with conveying aspects of history
over time, drawn from this resource and discussed in terms of their goals, similarities, and differences.
Finally, the Milestones database itself will be used to showcase how such a resource can serve as an interesting source of information for statistical historiography, which entails the use of statistical and graphical methods for the analysis and understanding of historical innovations, developments, and trends.
\end{abstract}


\section{Introduction}
\epigraph{If you would understand anything, observe its beginning and its development}{Aristotle}

Questions regarding the history of data visualization are (or at least should be) of great importance to historians of science,
to current developers of graphical methods for statistical analysis and the related info-vis community, as well
those just interested in the history of ideas.
In the history of science, diagrams, graphs, maps and other visualizations have often played important roles in discoveries
that arguably might not have been achieved otherwise.%
\footnote{
	Some salient examples are:
	Francis Galton's 1861
	discovery of anti-cyclonic movement of wind around low-pressure areas from contour maps;
	Edward Maunder's ``butterfly diagram'' of the variation of sunspots over time leading to the
	discovery of the ``Maunder minimum,'' from 1645--1715;
	and Henry Moselely's 1913 discovery of the concept of atomic number,
	based largely on graphical analysis (a plot of serial numbers of the elements vs.
	square root of frequencies from their X-ray spectra).
}
At the same time,
in the fields of statistical graphics and information visualization,
developers often create ``new'' methods without any appreciation that they have deep roots in the past.


These two perspectives provided the motivation for the development of the Milestones Project.
This stemmed from the fact that historical accounts of events, ideas and techniques that
relate \emph{inter alia} to modern data visualization were fragmented and
scattered across a wide number of fields.%
\footnote{
Among these are general histories
in the fields of probability \citep{Hald:1990}, statistics
\citep{Pearson:1978,Porter:1986,Stigler:1986}, astronomy \citep{Riddell:1980}, cartography \citep{WallisRobinson:87}.
More specialized accounts focus on the early history of graphic recording
\citep{HoffGeddes:1959,HoffGeddes:1962}, statistical graphs
\citep{Funkhouser:1936,Funkhouser:1937,Royston:1970,Tilling:1975}, fitting equations to empirical data
\citep{Farebrother:1999}, cartography \citep{Friis:1974,Kruskal:1977} and thematic mapping
\citep{FriendlyPalsky:2007,Palsky:1996,Robinson:1982}, and so forth.
}
When this work began in the mid 1990s, there were no accounts or resources that spanned the entire development
of visual thinking and the visual representation of data across different disciplines and perspectives.
The Milestones Project began simply as an attempt to collate these diverse contributions into a single,
comprehensive listing, organized chronologically, and containing representative images, references to
original sources and links to further discussion--- a source for ``One-Stop Shopping'' on the history of
data visualization.

In \secref{sec:project}, we describe the evolution of the Milestones Project. \secref{sec:vistime}
presents some historical and modern approaches to one self-referential question: how can data
visualization be applied to its own history? \secref{sec:historiography} introduces another self-referential
topic we
call \emph{statistical historiography},
which entails the use of statistical and graphical methods for the analysis and understanding of historical innovations, developments, and trends.
But first we give some brief vignettes of historical topics and questions for which the Milestones Project has
proved invaluable in our own research.

\subsection{The first statistical graph}
In the history of statistical graphics \citep{Friendly:06:hbook},
as in other artful sciences, there are a number of inventions and developments
that can be considered ``firsts'' in these fields.
The catalog of the Milestones Project
\citep{FriendlyDenis:01} lists 70 events that can be considered to be the
initial use or statement of an idea, method or technique that is now
commonplace, but there is probably no question more fundamental than
that of the first visual representation of statistical data.

\begin{figure}[htb]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig/langren-google-overlay}
 \caption{van Langren's 1644 graph, re-scaled and overlaid on a modern map of Europe.
 Toledo is located at
lat/long
%39$^o$51$^'$36$^\"$N, 4$^o$01$^'$48$^\"$W
(\degree{+39.86}N, \degree{-4.03}W), Rome is located at (\degree{+41.89}N, \degree{+12.5}W),
both shown by markers on the map.  This image makes clear what van Langren wished to communicate:
the wide variability of the estimates, but also shows how far the estimates were biased.}%
  \label{fig:langren-google-overlay}
\end{figure}

In \citet{Friendly-etal:2010:langren}
we argue that the 1-dimensional line graph shown in \figref{fig:langren-google-overlay}
by Michael Florent
van Langen \citep{Langren:1644} should be accorded this honor.
The graph shows 12 estimates of the distance in longitude between Toledo and Rome, overlaid on a modern map.
van Langren used this to demonstrate that these estimates were all subject to large errors and to
propose to King Phillip of Spain that only he had a sufficiently precise method for the determination
of longitude for navigation at sea.

The telling of van Langren's story turned out to involve astronomy, archival research,
patronage in the \Cent{17} and even an unsolved problem of cryptography,
but also serves as one example of statistical historiography.  For the present purposes
we note simply that the Milestones Project provided the infrastructure for this research---
a time-based, cross-referenced catalog of images, references and links to related work.

\subsection{Who invented the scatterplot?}
Although there are earlier precursors, the main graphical methods used today---
pie charts, line graphs and bar charts--- are generally attributed to
William Playfair in works around the beginning of the \Cent{19}
\citep{Playfair:1786,Playfair:1801}. All of these are essentially univariate
displays of some aspect of a single variable. The next major invention,
and the first true bivariate display is \scat\, whose use by
\citet{Galton:1886} led to the discovery of
correlation and regression, and ultimately to much of present multivariate
statistics. So, it is perhaps surprising that there is no one widely
credited with the invention of this idea.

In \citet{FriendlyDenis:05:scat} we trace the early origins of ideas related to
the scatterplot, why, in Playfair's time, it was nearly impossible to think about
and visualize bivariate relations, and how Galton's visual insight from
a scatterplot contributed to the rise of modern statistics and graphics.
But, the resources available in the Milestones Project allowed us to attribute
the essential ideas of the scatterplot to J. F. W. Herschel in two 1832 papers.

\subsection{The Golden Age of statistical graphics}

In our initial web presentation of the Milestones Project, it proved convenient
to sub-divide this history of data visualization into epochs, each of which turned
out to be describable by coherent themes.  For reasons we describe later, one
period turned out to be particularly noteworthy, both for the sheer number of
contributions and for the beauty and elegance of their execution.
We call this period, from roughly 1850 to 1900 ($\pm 10$) the Golden Age of
Statistical graphics \citep{Friendly:2008:golden}.

\figref{fig:mileyears4} shows the time distribution of 260 miletone events
listed in the Milestones Project in 2007 together with the labels we used for
epochs.
In \citet{Friendly:2008:golden} we trace the origin of this period in terms
of the infrastructure required to produce this explosive growth of contributions
to data visualization: systematic data collection by state agencies,
the rise of statistical and visual thinking, and enabling  developments of
technology.

\section{The Milestones Project}\label{sec:project}
An early overview of the content and aims of the Milestones Project appeared in \cite{Friendly:04:gfkl}.
Here we update that description and provide a few technical details on some problems in
documenting the history of data visualization in a convenient form for browsing, searching and
analysis.

\subsection{Origin, structure and evolution}\label{sec:structure}
The initial step in portraying the history of data visualization was a simple chronological listing of milestone items
with capsule descriptions, bibliographic references, markers for date, person, place, and links to portraits, images,
related sources or more detailed commentaries.
We started with 105
developments listed by \citet{BenigerRobyn:1978}
and incorporated additional listings from
\citet{Hankins:1999},  \citet{Tufte:1983,Tufte:1990,Tufte:1997},  \citet{Heiser:2000}, and others.

This began as single \LaTeX\ file (with markup tags for all relevant bits of information),
used to produce a
hyper-linked PDF document.  A variety of software tools (perl scripts, Unix utilities) allowed us to turn this
single source
\emph{directly} into the web version originally shown at
\url{http://www.math.yorku.ca/SCS/Gallery/milestone}.  Other custom software tools allowed us to
add new milestones items from text files using a template of tags (DATE:, AUTHOR:, WHAT:, REF:, IMG:, etc.)
and extract the
information about milestones items, authors, images, etc. in a variety of forms (CSV, XML, JSON)
that could be used as input for analyses and graphic displays.  For example, \figref{fig:mileyears4}
was produced in SAS software using a unix command pipe like
\begin{verbatim}
itemdb -o milestones.csv < milestones.tex | sas -i milestones.csv mileyears.sas
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}[!htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,clip]{fig/datavis-timeline2}
  \caption{Timeline view of the Milestones Project on the site \texttt{http://datavis.ca}. In this view,
  the top panel shows a detailed view of the segment of history highlighted in the bottom panel, both
  of which can be separately scrolled. Items in the top panel show a brief tag, color-coded in coarse
  categories. Clicking on an item in this panel brings up small description, linked to the details of
  the milestone item.
  }
  \label{fig:datavis-timeline2}
\end{figure}

It soon became apparent that such a text-based representation was inadequate.  Around 2005, we began
to convert this to a true database and
completely redesigned the Milestones web site. ...

\begin{figure}[!htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,clip]{fig/datavis-db-schema-reduced}
  \caption{Simplified schema for the MySQL database for the Milestones Project. The main 
  table (\texttt{milestone}) contains information regarding each of the items considered
  a milestone in the history of data visualization, linked to other tables 
  (e.g., \texttt{reference}, \texttt{mediaitem}) by unique keys.
  Other supporting tables, not shown here, provide for convenient lookup of 
  descriptors of these milestones items (\texttt{subject}, \texttt{aspect}, \texttt{keyword}).
  }
  \label{fig:datavis-db-schema}
\end{figure}


At present, the Milestones Project lists 288 contributions to this history, with nearly 350 references,
information on 336 authors and 774 ``media items'', comprising 371 images appearing online on the
\url{http://datavis.ca} site and 403 links to images and documents at other sites.
In addition, we maintain an offline image database comprising over 1100 images collected from
various sources, ...

landing page. ...

\begin{itemize*}
  \item Visions of history from the past
  \item Correlated pasts
  \item Non-linear scales
  \item Dynamic/interactive timelines
\end{itemize*}

\section{Using the Milestones Project for Statistical Historiography}\label{sec:historiography}
\begin{itemize*}
  \item comparisons of graphical innovations by field (e.g. physical sciences vs. social sciences), in terms of content and form
  \item extract themes and relationships between content areas
\end{itemize*}

\subsection{Statistical historiography}
We use the term ``statistical historiography,''
to refer to the use of statistical and graphical methods to
explore, study and describe historical problems and questions.%
\footnote{As far as we know, the initial expression of this idea appeared in a paper by
\citet{Rubin:1943} discussing various ways in which statistical methods could be applied
to historical topics.  These included the use of sampling methods to test historical theories,
statistical distributions applied to historical data, and the use of
time series graphs with smoothed curves to study historical trends.
More recently, many examples of the application of these ideas to statistical topics
can be found in \citet{Stigler:1986,Stigler:1999}, as well as our own papers
on the history of data visualization,
cited \emph{inter alia}.
}
This topic has a delightful self-referential quality when applied to the history of data visualization itself,
since we have often found ourselves using modern methods of statistical analysis and graphics to study
the development of ideas in this area.

At the same time, our examination of some of the most
impressive graphic works of the past sometimes left us awe-struck by their exquisite
beauty and visual design.%
\footnote{ Some examples are:
Charles Joseph Minard's famous depiction of Napoleon's March on Moscow \citep{Friendly:02:Minard},
Francis Galton's detailed study of weather patterns in Europe \citep[see:][]{Friendly:2008:golden},
and Andr{\'e}-Michel Guerry's \citep[Plate 17]{Guerry:1864}
semi-graphic table depicting the relations of occurrence of
crimes to a wide variety of social and demographic factors \citep[see:][]{Friendly:2007:guerry}
...
}
On more than one occasion, we wondered whether there wasn't something lost with the advent of modern
software: We can now analyze massive data sets and generate many graphs with simple mouse clicks
or software commands, but designing a truly effective graphic display requires much thought and
a lot of manual intervention.

There is, of course,  one principal requirement for statistical historiography: \textbf{data}.
The milestones database is the repository of all the information we have so far recorded,
and modern database tools allow the possibility of simple or complex queries, limited only
by the available information.

In related work, we have also collected and disseminated
data sets of historical interest on a variety of
topics in statistics and data visualization, for example in the R packages
HistData \citep{HistData} and Guerry \citep{Guerry}.

In the subsections below, we describe a few applications of these ideas using the milestones
database and case studies that arose from this work. There is an interesting interplay between
such historical analyses and these data collections. Some studies called for us to find and
incorporate new data sources, such as our paper \citep{Friendly:2007:guerry} on
Guerry's \emph{Moral statistics of France} and the Guerry package to which we added
Angeville's 1836
extensive data on social and economic characteristics of France.
In other cases, our analyses suggested new or different ways to visualize historical data.

\subsection{Milestone authors: lifespan}\label{sec:lifespan}
As noted earlier, we record information relevant to the contributors of milestones events in an
author table in the database. Internet and biographical searches for these persons allowed us
to determine the dates and places of their birth and death in a large number of cases.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,clip]{fig/lifespan}
  \caption{Density plot of the lifespan of 172 authors in the milestones database born after 1500 and for whom
  lifespan can be determined. Individual observations are shown by a (jittered) rug plot, and the three extremes
  on each end are identified by name.  The dashed lines show the quartiles of the distribution.
  }
  \label{fig:lifespan}
\end{figure}

One simple question is how long did these contributors live? As illustrated earlier (figref:)
Joseph Priestley was the first to develop the idea of using a graphic representation to show
the lifespan of famous men. His ``charts of biography'' did this in a particularly evocative
form, showing each person by a line segment identified by name, and grouped into
occupational categories.

However, such ``lifeline'' charts don't provide any answers to this question.  With the
author table, it is a simple matter to calculate lifespan, and give a direct answer
with the help of software.  \figref{fig:lifespan} shows one display of this information,
using a combined density plot and rug plot, as we used in \figref{fig:mileyears4}.

Several features of this plot deserve comment, and also invite further inquiry:
Most notable is that, by and large, milestones authors generally lived to a ripe old age--
the median lifespan is 73.0, but the density plot peaks at around 79.
This contrasts with a detailed study by
David de la Croix and Omar Licandro (\url{http://www.fcs.edu.uy/archivos/BCU_clebrities.pdf})
of famous people from 2400 BC to 1880 AD,
fluctuating around a mean of 61 years for 4 millennia, and only reaching a mean of 69 years
by the end of their sample. To take this analysis further would require more data, for example
a classification of authors by occupational groups.

Second, there is a noticeable bump in the distribution around 45 years. This
occurrence also calls for some attempt at further explanation.
We don't pursue this here, but again note that such graphs often suggest
further analyses (breakdowns by region or time period)
or cry out for the collection of more data.

Finally, although \figref{fig:lifespan} is just a summary graph, we have labeled a few
extreme observations on each end, which may relate to telling parts of the story of the
history of data visualization.  Among these, Henry Moselely, who is known for the
discovery of atomic number from a graphical display, died the youngest, as a consequence
of serving in the British Army in World War I. But, we were surprised to see
the noted and prolific French cartographer Phillippe Buache
and the German physicist and astronomer Johann Tobias Mayer show up in positions
2-3.  On the other end, we were delighted to see that Adriano Balbi,
a Venetian geographer and early collaborator of Andr{\'e}-Michel Guerry
\citep{BalbiGuerry:1829} had the longest lifespan,
just exceeding the population geneticist, Sewall Wright, who invented
path analysis and the path diagram around 1920.

\subsection{Milestone authors: geography}\label{sec:geography}
The Milestones Project web site provides an initial page showing an interactive timeline
of the events events in this history as a visual overview (\figref{fig:mileyears4}).
A long-term goal has been to
provide other views of this history and other tools for searching and exploring the
database.

The geography of these developments so far is only represented in the birth place
and death place information we recorded in the author table.
For example, we know that Minard was born in Dijon, and died in Bordeaux, but
all of his work was done in Paris while he worked at the
{\'E}cole Nationale des Ponts et Chauss{\'e}es.

Nevertheless, a geographic view of the available information is potentially useful.
In this regard, we used the Google geocoding tools to provide latitude and
longitude for the place names listed in the author table.  Using this and the
R package googleVis \citep{googleVis} we easily created the interactive map shown
in \figref{fig:authormap}

Like other Google maps, this can be panned and zoomed using mouse controls.
The place markers display tool tips when hovered and, when clicked, link to
a search page showing milestone items related to that author.
This tool seems sufficiently useful that we are adding it as another visual
overview page to the milestones site.
