Questions regarding the history of data visualization are (or at least should 
be) of great importance to historians of science, to current developers of 
graphical methods for statistical analysis and the related info-vis community, 
as well those just interested in the history of ideas.
In the history of science, diagrams, graphs, maps and other visualizations have 
often played important roles in discoveries that arguably might not have been 
achieved otherwise.%
\footnote{
	Some salient examples are:
	Francis Galton's 1861 discovery of anti-cyclonic movement of wind 
    around low-pressure areas from contour maps; Edward Maunder's ``butterfly 
    diagram'' of the variation of sunspots over time leading to the	discovery of 
    the ``Maunder minimum,'' from 1645--1715; and Henry Moselely's 1913 discovery 
    of the concept of atomic number, based largely on graphical analysis (a plot of 
    serial numbers of the elements vs. square root of frequencies from their X-ray 
    spectra).
}
At the same time, in the fields of statistical graphics and information 
visualization, developers often create ``new'' methods without any appreciation 
that they have deep roots in the past.%
\footnote{
  For example, mosaic displays for frequency tables were thought to have been 
  invented by \citet{HartiganKleiner:81} and extended to show the pattern of 
  residuals in loglinear models by \citet{Friendly:94a}.
  But it turns out that the essential idea behind this area-based display  goes 
  back to Georg von Mayr in 1877 \citep{Friendly:2002:mosahist}.
}

These two perspectives provided the motivation for the development of the 
Milestones Project. 
\begin{comment}
Rephrase the second sentence: Previous historical accounts of events, ideas and 
techniques that relate \emph{inter alia} to modern data visualizations were 
fragmented - scattered across a wide number of fields, publications, and 
languages (insert footnote here).
The present project's goal was to bring these resources together into a 
publicly and freely available database.

This stemmed from the fact that historical accounts of events, ideas and 
techniques that relate \emph{inter alia} to modern data visualization were 
fragmented and scattered across a wide number of fields.%
\footnote{
Among these are general histories in the fields of probability 
\citep{Hald:1990}, statistics \citep{Pearson:1978,Porter:1986,Stigler:1986}, 
astronomy \citep{Riddell:1980}, cartography \citep{WallisRobinson:87}.
More specialized accounts focus on the early history of graphic recording 
\citep{HoffGeddes:1959,HoffGeddes:1962}, statistical graphs 
\citep{Funkhouser:1936,Funkhouser:1937,Royston:1970,Tilling:1975}, fitting 
equations to empirical data \citep{Farebrother:1999}, cartography 
\citep{Friis:1974,Kruskal:1977}, thematic mapping 
\citep{FriendlyPalsky:2007,Palsky:1996,Robinson:1982}, and so forth.
}

When this work began in the mid-1990s, there were no accounts or resources that 
spanned the entire development of visual thinking and the visual representation 
of data across different disciplines and perspectives.
The Milestones Project began simply as an attempt to collate these diverse 
contributions into a single, comprehensive listing, organized chronologically, 
that contained representative images, references to original sources, and links 
to further discussion--- a source for ``one-stop shopping'' on the history of 
data visualization.

In \secref{sec:project}, we describe the evolution and structure of the 
Milestones Project. \secref{sec:vistime} presents some historical and modern 
approaches to one self-referential question: how can data visualization be 
applied to its own history? 
\secref{sec:historiography} introduces another self-referential topic we call 
\emph{statistical historiography}, which entails the use of statistical and 
graphical methods for the analysis and understanding of historical innovations, 
developments, and trends.
But first we give some brief vignettes of historical topics and questions for 
which the Milestones Project has proved invaluable in our own research.

\subsection{The first statistical graph}
In the history of statistical graphics \citep{Friendly:06:hbook}, as in other 
artful sciences, there are a number of inventions and developments that can be 
considered ``firsts'' in these fields.
The catalog of the Milestones Project \citep{FriendlyDenis:01} lists 70 events 
that can be considered to be the initial use or statement of an idea, method or 
technique that is now commonplace, but there is probably no question more 
fundamental than that of the first visual representation of statistical data.

In \citet{Friendly-etal:2010:langren} we argue that the 1-dimensional line 
graph shown in \figref{fig:langren-google-overlay} by Michael Florent van 
Langen \citep{Langren:1644} should be accorded this honour. The graph shows 12 estimates of the distance in longitude between Toledo (located at lat/long %39$^o$51$^'$36$^\"$N, 4$^o$01$^'$48$^\"$W
(\degree{+39.86}N, \degree{-4.03}W)) and Rome (located at (\degree{+41.89}N, \degree{+12.5}W)).  The figure, which has been re-scaled, and overlaid on a modern map of Europe, makes clear what van Langren wished to communicate: that these estimates were all subject to large errors and to propose to King Phillip of Spain that only he had a sufficiently precise method for the determination of longitude for navigation at sea.  By also including markers (stars) on the map itself, the present version also demonstrates to the reader the extent to which \emph{all} of the estimates were biased.

\end{figure}

The telling of van Langren's story not only turned out to involve astronomy, 
archival research, the history of patronage in the \Cent{17}, and even an 
unsolved problem of cryptography, but also serves as an example of statistical 
historiography.
The Milestones Project provided the infrastructure for this research -- through 
the use of a time-based, cross-referenced catalog of images, references and 
links to related work, van Langren's tale was able to be studied and reported 
upon.

\subsection{Who invented the scatterplot?}
%\TODO{MF: Revert or merge some of this text with the version as of 29 Aug... }
Although there are earlier precursors, the main graphical methods used today---
pie charts, line graphs and bar charts--- are generally attributed to
William Playfair in works around the beginning of the \Cent{19}
\citep{Playfair:1786,Playfair:1801}.
All of these are essentially univariate
displays of some aspect of a single variable. 

A logical next step would be to invent a method to reveal the relationship 
between two variables--- what we now know as the scatterplot.
By \citeyear{Galton:1886}, Francis Galton had utilized this truly bivariate 
display, which led to the
discovery of correlation and regression, and ultimately to much of present 
multivariate
statistics. 
However, he was not the first to use this graphical technique, and it is 
surprising that no one is widely credited with its invention.

In \citet{FriendlyDenis:05:scat}, we delved into this mystery.
This involved tracing the early origins of ideas related to the scatterplot, 
which led to two compelling narratives: how, in Playfair's time, it was nearly 
impossible to think about and visualize bivariate relationships; and, later, 
how the scatterplot was essential for Galton's visual insights that would lead 
to the rise of modern statistics and graphics.
It was the resources available in the Milestones Project that allowed us to 
focus upon the events in this period and attribute the essential ideas of the 
scatterplot to J. F. W. Herschel in two 1832 papers.

\subsection{The Golden Age of statistical graphics}

In our initial web presentation of the Milestones Project, it proved convenient
to sub-divide the history of data visualization into epochs, each of which 
turned
out to be describable by coherent themes.
As we illustrate later, one
period turned out to be particularly noteworthy, both for the sheer number of
contributions, and for the beauty and elegance of their execution.
We call this period, from roughly 1850 to 1900 ($\pm 10$), the Golden Age of 
statistical graphics \citep{Friendly:2008:golden}.

\figref{fig:mileyears4} shows the time distribution of the 260 significant 
events that had been included in the Milestones Project database by 2007, 
demarcated by the labels we used for epochs.  The density estimate is based on $n=260$ significant events in the history of data of data visualization from 1500--present.The developments in the highlighted period, from roughly 1840--1910 comprise the Golden Age of statistical graphics.
In \citet{Friendly:2008:golden}, we traced the origin of this period in terms 
of the infrastructure required to produce such an explosive growth of 
contributions to data visualization, and found three primary sources: the 
systematic data collection by state agencies, the rise in popularity of 
statistical and visual thinking, and the enabling developments of technological 
innovations.
