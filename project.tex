\section{The Milestones Project}\label{sec:project}
An early overview of the content and aims of the Milestones Project appeared in \cite{Friendly:04:gfkl}.
Here we update that description and provide a few technical details on some problems in
documenting the history of data visualization in a convenient form for browsing, searching and
analysis.

\subsection{Origin, structure and evolution}\label{sec:structure}
The initial step in portraying the history of data visualization was a simple chronological listing of milestone items
with capsule descriptions, bibliographic references, markers for date, person, place, and links to portraits, images,
related sources or more detailed commentaries.
We started with 105
developments listed by \citet{BenigerRobyn:1978}
and incorporated additional listings from
\citet{Hankins:1999},  \citet{Tufte:1983,Tufte:1990,Tufte:1997},  \citet{Heiser:2000}, and others.

This began as single \LaTeX\ file (with markup tags for all relevant bits of information),
used to produce a
hyper-linked PDF document.  A variety of software tools (perl scripts, Unix utilities) allowed us to turn this
single source
\emph{directly} into the web version originally shown at
\url{http://www.math.yorku.ca/SCS/Gallery/milestone}.  Other custom software tools allowed us to
add new milestones items from text files using a template of tags (DATE:, AUTHOR:, WHAT:, REF:, IMG:, etc.)
and extract the
information about milestones items, authors, images, etc. in a variety of forms (CSV, XML, JSON)
that could be used as input for analyses and graphic displays.  For example, \figref{fig:mileyears4}
was produced in SAS software using a unix command pipe like
\begin{verbatim}
itemdb -o milestones.csv < milestones.tex | sas -i milestones.csv mileyears.sas
\end{verbatim}

  the top panel shows a detailed view of the segment of history highlighted in the bottom panel, both
  of which can be separately scrolled. Items in the top panel show a brief tag, color-coded in coarse
  categories. Clicking on an item in this panel brings up small description, linked to the details of
  the milestone item.

It soon became apparent that such a text-based representation was inadequate. Updating the milestones data 
required that the single \LaTeX\ file be shared between multiple collaborators over email, and milestones 
assets, such as images or URLs were stored on a single computer not easily accessible by other collaborators.
As a result, collaboration with more than a few collaborators was cumbersome. The single file needed to be vetted 
at each iteration, and once enough data had been collected, rendered into a web site and manually uploaded so
that non-collaborators, namely the public, would be able to view the data.

Around 2005, we began to convert the flat file into a relational data and completely redesign the Milestones 
web site. Specifically, we wanted to facilitate collaboration between any number of collaborators via an easy
to use web administration area and allow for the dissemination of milestones data via an easy to browse public 
user interface, both of which would be tied to a relational database.

Migrating the data to this form provided some challenges. First, the existing milestones data needed to be
normalized and redundancy minimized. To do this, we broke the data into its relavent entities namely the 
milestone itself and its descriptors (aspect, author, subject, keywords, reference, and mediaitem).
The aspect, author, subject, keyword and reference descriptors exist as a many-to-many relationship between 
it and the milestone. For example an aspect can belong to one or more milestones and the mileston can belong to 
one or more aspects. While media items on the other hand, can belong to only one milestone at a time, with
multiple mediaitems possible for a single milestone. \figref{fig:datavis-schems-2} describes these relationships.

Normalizing the data in this way enabled us to free the databse of modification anomalies; ensured that database 
structure was scalable and could be extended with minimum mofications; made the relational model more informative 
to users; and made sure the data itself was query-neutral (Codd, 1971).

The second challenge related to how to display such a vast amount of information in an easy to understand
user interface...

  table (\texttt{milestone}) contains information regarding each of the items considered
  a milestone in the history of data visualization, linked to other tables 
  (e.g., \texttt{reference}, \texttt{mediaitem}) by unique (primary) keys.
  Other supporting tables (e.g., \texttt{milestone2aspect}) provide for convenient lookups of 
  descriptors of these milestones items (\texttt{subject}, \texttt{aspect}, \texttt{keyword}).

At present, the Milestones Project lists 288 contributions to this history, with nearly 350 references,
information on 336 authors and 774 ``media items'', comprising 371 images appearing online on the
\url{http://datavis.ca} site and 403 links to images and documents at other sites.
In addition, we maintain an offline image database comprising over 1100 images collected from
various sources, ...
