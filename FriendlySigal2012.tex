\title{The Milestones Project: \\ A Database for the History of Data Visualization}
\author{Michael Friendly \and Matthew Sigal \and Derek Harnanansingh}
\date{\today}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
%\TODO{Revise, incorporating some/all of Matt's changes, presently just comments in the .tex file; in general, abstract %should be shortened.}
\begin{comment}
Re-reading the abstract, I think it could be rephrased slightly to update the language with more modern historical scholarship (most of the changes are in paragraph 1).  Here is what I propose:

Methods of data visualization have evolved substantially over their relatively brief history.
Landmarks in this story were the first thematic maps in the 1600s, the invention of the bar chart and the line graph in the early 1800s,
and the dynamic and interactive graphics of today.  While these developments have been previously detailed in various micro-histories,
they were aimed at a privileged and academic audience, and a publicly accessible and free space to house a macro-history in its totality did not exist.

The purpose of this chapter is threefold:
first, to introduce the reader our solution to this absence through an online resource called the Milestones Project.
This website highlights important events in the history of data visualization, and enables users to interactively travel through time to see and explore the
context that surrounded their developments.
Secondly, we present some striking visual examples that deal with conveying aspects of history over time, drawn from this resource.
Finally, the Milestones database itself will be used to showcase how such a resource can serve as ``data'' for \emph{statistical historiography},
which entails the use of statistical and graphical methods for the analysis and understanding of historical innovations, developments, and trends.

and the dynamic and interactive graphics of today.  
While these developments have been previously detailed in various written micro-histories, 
there has never been an attempt to collect a complete, macro-history in a single place for study, search or query and even data analysis or graphics based on this history.

\begin{comment}
Approaches to modern data visualization have evolved substantially from the first thematic maps of the 1600s and the first bar charts and line graphs in the early 1800s to the dynamic and interactive graphics of today. Over the course of this history, there have been many detailed written studies, both comprehensive and on particular aspects. But there has never been an attempt to collect this history in a single place for display, search or query and even data analysis or graphics based on this history.

\section{Conclusion and Future Directions}
The Milestones Project began as a simple attempt to collect a comprehensive history of innovations and developments in data visualization in a single, ``one-stop-shopping'' location. Like Topsy, it ``just grew'' over time, with images, historical papers and references, suggestions, and other contributions graciously provided by friends and collaborators, most notably from the members of \emph{Les Chevaliers des Albums de Statistique Graphique}.

In this chapter, our primary goal was to introduce the second and latest iteration of this project.  The redesign was undertaken to make this history more accessible for browsing and searching, and to attempt to make the database more amenable to additions, edits, and extensions among collaborators.  However, we find that the most exciting aspect of the new structure is its flexibility in terms of data retrieval, and our newfound ability to use and manipulate the data for graphic-based statistical historiography.
